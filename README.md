## About me
My name is Jordan Patton. I have a background in audio engineering and sales.
My career goals are to continue to learn as much as I can about forthcoming tech. and how to utilize that in my line of work
I chose Fintech because it seemed like a great course to teach me more about stock anaylsis and future company growth. I honestly did not know it involved coding at first. So I'm excited about that!
